              		<p class="p1">The Great Pacific Garbage Patch is a collection of marine debris in the North Pacific Ocean. Also known as the Pacific trash vortex, the garbage patch is actually two distinct collections of debris bounded by the massive North Pacific Subtropical Gyre. Marine debris is litter that ends up in the ocean, seas, and other large bodies of water.</p>

This convergence zone is where warm water from the South Pacific meets up with cooler water from the Arctic. The zone acts like a highway that moves debris from one patch to another. 
        			The entire Great Pacific Garbage Patch is bounded by the North Pacific Subtropical Gyre.  The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) defines a gyre as a large system of swirling ocean currents. <br><br>The amount of debris in the Great Pacific Garbage Patch accumulates because much of it is not biodegradable.

Charles Moore, the man who discovered the vortex, says cleaning up the garbage patch would “bankrupt any country” that tried it.

In addition, not all of the trash floats on the surface. Denser debris can sink centimeters or even several meters beneath the surface, making the vortex’s area nearly impossible to measure.

         			The more we recycle, the less garbage winds up in our landfills and incineration plants. By reusing aluminum, paper, glass, plastics, and other materials, we can save production and energy costs, and reduce the negative impacts that the extraction and processing of virgin materials has on the environment.</p>

          			Awareness-raising<hr></hr>
          			<p class="p4">An effective way to improve attitudes towards waste reuse and recycling is to integrate waste management education into school curriculum and particularly teaching children about the causes and consequences of waste disposal and highlighting the importance of waste prevention, reuse and recycling. Local authorities and/or waste management organisations can facilitate this by undertaking outreach activities, sending representatives to local schools or inviting schoolchildren to facility tours or open days, etc.<br><br>

          			Best practice in awareness-raising is to effectively encourage waste prevention, reuse and recycling behaviour within the waste collection catchment area. Ultimately, this should translate into improved performance across key waste generation and separation indicators. Particular emphasis is placed on reaching all stakeholders, including non-native speakers via multilingual or pictorial communication ad via school activities. <br><br>

          			Well designed and developed awareness campaigns may contribute to the overcome of the two main barriers to recycling; the lack of knowledge where information about proper waste segregation is communicated to the citizens and changing attitudes and perceptions and keep people motivated to avoid and sort waste.<br><br>  

					The awareness campaigns for citizens can be delivered directly by the waste management organisation, by professional agencies on their behalf, or by partner organisations (including stakeholders in other sectors). A whole range of communication channels can be used, which can include advertising, public relations, direct marketing, community engagement, online engagement, social media and product labelling.<br><br>

					Last but not least, the improvement of the uptake of the waste management services results in better economic performance as well.
